ONCE UPON A TIME a brother and sister named Hansel and Gretel who lived in a hut in the woods with their father, a poor woodcutter.
Their mother had died when the children were very young, and after a number of years their father remarried.
As soon as that new stepmother moved in, she made life very hard for the children.
Hansel and Gretel were not allowed to eat until after the stepmother had eaten everything she wanted off the plates.
Most of the time, only scraps were left.  Each day the children had to work long and hard to finish the chores.
